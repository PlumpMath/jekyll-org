        Well, it is never easy to explain oneself to others.
      </p>
      

      <p> 
        I was grown up in Sun-chon located in southern-west part of South 
        Korea.  And I had stayed there until I graduate my high school and 
        moved to Seoul.

        I graduate Computer Engineering Dept. of Hongik University.
        I've been a member of local Computer Circle,
        <a href="http://pcrc.hongik.ac.kr/">P.C.R.C.</a>, 
        and have been teaching C programming language since 1996.

        I like traveling abroad, especially with my friends. Side picture
        was taken when I was traveling Osaka, Japan.

        I like animals; those which are able to recognize me as its partner
        or friend. So I like dogs and cats, few birds.  Unfortunately,
        I've had no experience with birds.  I think my fondness toward birds
        are from fairy tales where each infamous pirate raises its own parrot.

        Anyway, I've got one Pomeranian, name's Jury and one cross-bred cat,
        name's Ming-Ming.  Jury is 13 years old which means she's quite old 
        lady, while Ming-Ming is just 2-year-old kitten.
        They live my parent's house right now.
