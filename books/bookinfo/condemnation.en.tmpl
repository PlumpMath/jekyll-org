description: <p>The forces aligned against Menzoberranzan begin to \
take shape, and the threat to drow civilization is more terrifying \
than anyone has yet imagined. From the impenetrable shadows of the \
Underdark to the remote corners of the no less unforgiving World \
Above, the path toward the secrets of Lolth's silence is as \
unpredictable as it is deadly.</p> \
<p>Joined by two drow who might be the last survivors of Ched Nasad, \
the explorers from Menzoberranzan have learned much, but for every \
answer they find, a thousand new questions arise. They must seek out a \
rival priest, in hopes that he can speed them on their way to the \
goddess herself, but can one dark elf ever trust another? </p>
