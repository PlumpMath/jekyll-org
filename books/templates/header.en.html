    <h1>Seong-Kook Shin's Bookshelf</h1>

    <p>These are some of my purchased book list.  I made this page for
      my personal use, since I frequently forgot what I've bought and 
      what I've read.</p>

    <p>What made me surprised is that some people asked me about my recent
      book list for an advice or for their own purpose.  Since they have
      similar skills that I have, and they have similar tastes of books,
      I decided to maintain this page for public.</p>

    <p>Don't take serious my description of each book here; They're really
      personal descriptions.  You may criticize that some of descriptions are
      not correct, or not suitable.  For example, some of mathematics books 
      here may have some bad tendency of criticism. In this case, you must
      catch that my mathematics is very bad. ;-)</p>

    <p>It is very boring, time-consuming work to typing each book information
      whenever I buy a new book.  Thus this page is automatically generated
      based on book information using Tcl scripts and Makefile.  If you
      want to know more about this automation, read 
      <a href="howtomake.html">here</a>.</p>
