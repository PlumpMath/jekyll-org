description: <p><em>Station is the paradox of the world of my people,\
the limitation of our power within the hunger for power.\
It is gained through treachery and invites treachery against\
those who gain it. Those most powerful in Menzoberranzan spend their days\
watching over their shoulders,\
defending against the daggers that would find their backs.\
Their deaths usually come from the front.</em></p>\
