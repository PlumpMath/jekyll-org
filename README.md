Jekyll with Emacs Org-Mode

You can see the jekyll-org generated site [here](http://cinsk.github.com/jekyll-org/).  See the article in [Articles]->[Jekyll with org-mode and twitter bootstrap] there.

- Pre-configured for [Twitter Bootstrap Scaffolding style](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html).
- Your articles (in Emacs org-mode) will be automatically used as the source to jekyll.

Usage
-----

Read the article, [Jekyll with org-mode and twitter bootstrap](http://cinsk.github.com/jekyll-org/articles/jekyll-org.html), which is also generated using this package.


Note
----

Commit `c9e8fc0` was the last working version against jekyll 0.12.0 with org-mode version 
just below version of org-mode version 8.0.3 in my system.  (I forgot the actual version of
org-mode at that time)

Commit `f191c5c` was the first version against jekyll 1.0.3 and org-mode 8.0.5
