    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <p> 
      I enjoy traveling the world. Luckily I've managed my time
      to travel several countries. Here I collect some of photos from
      those places, and write some letter to my friends to show how
      I was okay.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=canada">Canada</a></h2>
    <p>
      I went to canada to get a English language practice for
      five month...
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=japan">Japan</a></h2>
    <p>
      At first time, I went to Japan to see my favorite foreign
      friend, Xie Yan(謝艶)...
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=usa">USA</a></h2>
    <p>
      Not for a pleasure, but for business I went to Las Vegas...
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=brazil">Brazil</a></h2>
    <p>
      My friend, Bartira Ibri looks forward to see me in her country,
      Brasil. Though the correct spell is "Brazil", she wants to write
      her country as "Brasil", the correct spell in her national language,
      Portuguese...
    </p>
      
    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=china">China</a></h2>
    <p>My friend, Xie Yan(謝艶) sent some of her picture of her stay in Shanghai
      China.  Her family is there.</p>

    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=korea-grandpark">Korea --
       Seoul Grand Park</a></h2>
    <p>I went the park with Hee-Kyoung and Noriko in fall of 2004.</p>

    <h2><a href="./browse.cgi?cwd=yan-korea">Korea --
	Yan's Trip</a></h2>
    <p>My friend, Xie Yan(謝艶) finally came to Korea for 3 days (from Sun May
      8 2005 to Tue May 10 2005).  Unfortunately, I couldn't get two days
      vacation, so I spent only two days with Yan.  I wished that we could
      have had much more time to enjoy, but we're all employeed so we couldn't
      get enough time.  In the last day, when I was in the office, I called
      Yan to say good bye, and I found myself that I really missed our times
      in Toronto...  </p>

    <p>Pictures with flowers are taken from Japan,
      during her flower coordinating lesson.  I just received from Yan.</p>
