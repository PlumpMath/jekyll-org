      First of all, I want my homepage is properly visible with
      <em>any browser</em>.  I am not fastidious, just I want to
      see my page using text browsers like 
      <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/">elinks</a>
      or
      <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a>. 
      Text browsers are not suitable for everybody's choice. But they
      are exceptionally handy if you're developing web application or
      using text terminal emulators. That's why.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I was younger than now,
      I read few articles like a
      <a href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/">any browser 
      campaign</a> or concepts similar to 
      <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html">HTML
        Hell Page</a>
      by <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a>, 
      and disguised myself to a fanatic follower of those
      concepts hoping that people looks me somewhat differently.
      But not now. From now on, I want to say my idea, not others.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many WYSIWYG tools that make web documents easy.
      But I prefer not to use them.  Using those tools may save your
      time greatly, but it uses excessive HTML tags so that browsers
      need more time to parse and display pages, and make hard to read
      sources of web pages.
    </p>

    <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">
      <img align="right" border="0" width="93" height="123"
        src="img/lynx.jpg" alt="lynx image"
        longdesc="This image may be subject to copyright by www.kosice.sk/zoo/."></img>
    </a>
    <p>
      Thus, I make my web page manually using popular text editors
      like <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>,
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> or
      <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>.

      I don't want to ignite text editor war here, although I prefer
      XEmacs most.
    </p>
      
    <p>As far as I concern, proper indentation with consistent style
      is the first priority when creating any kind of documents or
      codes.  Personally I loath people who makes ugly text.
      It doesn't matter you're developing a program code, writing
      reports or creating web document.

      In an excessive manner, I would prefer writing
      not-working-but-looks-good code rather than 
      working-nicely-but-unreadable code. Am I going too far? ;-) 
    </p>

    <p>
      And the second reason, I have very poor sense of beauty; colors
      and coordinates. It's very hard for me to make my homepage 
      pretty and gorgeous.  Until now, I admit that I was stealing
      page design of others who makes their pages pretty nice. But
      I'm not going to do that any more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before now, I was proudly show my e-mail address in my pages
      with proper URL so that people who want to contact me would
      not have any problem.  
      I don't want to put my e-mail address directly because of those
      bastard spammers! I don't want to
      receive more than 100 hundred junk mails a day 
      (I'm not kidding!) 
      Can you imagine that I gave up my favorite e-mail account
      which I used from 1994 just because I received too many junk
      mails? *sigh*
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a person who sends spam to other people, think about
      it really seriously.  Sending spams do not help your business.
      Worse, your action makes people angry with you. Believe me,
      sending spams has only bad effect on your business, unless your
      business is selling other people's mail addresses to other
      spammers.
