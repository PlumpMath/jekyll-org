    <p>
      Artist mode, toggled by <span class="tt">M-x artist-mode</span>, lets you
      draw lines, squares, rectangles and poly-lines, ellipses,
      and circles with your mouse and/or keyboard.  It is extremely
      useful when inserting text diagrams or figures in your source
      comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beside editing commands, above demonstration uses following Emacs
      commands:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="tt">C-x b</span> to switch buffers. Originally,
        it is bound for `switch-to-buffer'.  Instead, binding
        `iswitchb-buffer' to <span class="tt">C-x b</span> is much easier
        to use.</li>

      <li><span class="tt">C-x n n</span> to narrow the region,
        `narrow-to-region'.
        It is very useful to prevent the unwanted change on other portion
        of the buffer, and makes the user concentrating on what he or she
        want to do.  The narrowing is reverted by the command,
        <span class="tt">C-x n w</span> `widen'.</li>
    </ul>
