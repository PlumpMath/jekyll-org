    <h1>C Programming FAQs (Korean)</h1>

    <p>[ English | <a href="./index-ko.html">Korean</a> ]</p>
    <p>
      I provide Korean translation of C Programming FAQs,
      the official FAQ from usenet <a href="news:comp.lang.c">comp.lang.c</a>
      which is written by 
      <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/">Steve Summit</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for his permission, I was able to translate this document in 
      Korean.  If you need any copyright information about my translation, 
      read a few front pages of the document.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      This document is somewhat different than the original on-line 
      C FAQ list. Here are some plans and it's features:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li> All answers will have appropriate references regarding to C99.
      (See the Reference Chapter for [HS2002], [C99], [ISO Rationale],
      and [SUS].)</li>
    <li> All contents in the original on-line C FAQ list is already 
      included.</li>
    <li> Borrowed some examples in the book version, <em>C Programming FAQs --
        Frequently Asked Question</em> (Addison Wesley, 0-201-84519-9)
      will be included.</li>
    <li> Later, we will have many questions and answers regarding to
      new C99 features plus wide character set and multibyte characters</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>
      Note that any format type of this document is far from printing quality.
      Currently, I'm concentrating the contents itself, not design nor layout
      problem.
    </p>


    <h2>Files</h2>
    <p>
      Note that this document is far more than just translation of Steve's work.
      I've updated it from time to time to inject missing part (e.g. 
      internationalization, new concepts in ISO/IEC 9899:1999, known as C99).
    </p>

    <p>
      When I first started this work, I found myself being enjoyed with 
      non-WYSIWYG document processing; especially LaTeX.  
      Thus, the translation is provided as PostScript and 
      Portable Document Format (PDF if you want).
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally! By the public demands, I rebuilt HTML version of this document,
      The HTML version has more recent than .ps or .pdf version. And 
      (of course) it's searchable. And I put more effort to make rich
      hyperlinks to each question.  So, try HTML version first.

    <h2>Help Wanted</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to help me to make this document better, please read following
      items carefully and send e-mail to me.
    </p>

    <p>   
      If you find any better way to generate .ps or .pdf file from
      the LaTeX source, please let me know.  Unfortunately, searching 
      Hangul(Korean) text is not possible
      in my .pdf documents. I generate .pdf by using
      <a href="http://project.ktug.or.kr/dvipdfmx/">dvipdfmx</a>.
      If you know how to make searchable PDF documents, please let me know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among other things, reporting any errata, giving me a suggestion or an
      advice is the most helpful contribution. ;-)
